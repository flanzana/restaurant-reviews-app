# Restaurant Reviews App

## Introduction
For the **Restaurant Reviews** project, I took a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I added a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for my users.


## Installation
- Open [Restaurant Reviews](https://flanzana.github.io/restaurant-reviews-app/) and enjoy the website.


## How I built the app
I have been provided the code for a restaurant reviews website. The code had a lot of issues. It was barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. It also didn’t include any standard accessibility features, and it didn’t work offline at all. My job was to update the code to resolve these issues while still maintaining the included functionality. I implemented the required features in three areas: responsive design, accessibility and offline use.
